  // The Gain object specifies the volume scaling to be performed for a given
  // Mix operation, when mixing a single stream into some combined resultant
  // audio stream. Restated, a Mix has one or more Sources, and it combines
  // these Sources to get a single stream for that Mix's Destination.
  // Correspondingly, Gain objects relate one-to-one with Source streams and
  // share a Destination stream with all other Source streams in that mix.
  // During playback, the renderer stream is the Source, and the output device
  // is the Destination. During capture, the input device is the Source, and the
  // capturer stream is the Destination (emitted via API to app clients).
  //
  // These SetGain calls set the source's or destination's contribution to a
  // link's overall software gain control. For stream gain, we allow values in
  // the range [-inf, 24.0]. Callers must guarantee single-threaded semantics
  // for each Gain instance. This is guaranteed today because only API-side
  // components (not mixer) call this from their execution domain (guaranteeing
  // single-threadedness). This value is stored in atomic float -- the Mixer can
  // consume it at any time without needing a lock for synchronization.

  // response to SetGain calls. For playback, this generally always means writes
  // of the SOURCE gain (for capture, generally this means DEST gain changes --
  // either way we are talking about changes to the Stream's gain). DEST gain is
  // provided to Gain objects, but those objects don't own this setting. Gain
  // objects correspond to stream mixes, so they are 1-1 with source gains;
  // however, there are many stream mixes for a single destination -- thus many
  // gain objects share the same destination (share the same dest gain). So,
  // gain objects don't contain the definitive value of any dest gain.
