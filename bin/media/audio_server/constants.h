// The number of fractional bits used when expressing timestamps (in frame
// units) as fixed point integers.  Ultimately, this determines the resolution
// that a source of PCM frames may be sampled at; there are 2^frac_bits
// positions between audio frames that the source stream may be sampled at.
//
// Using 64-bit signed timestamps means that we have 51 bits of whole frame
// units to work with.  At 192KHz, this allows for ~372.7 years of usable range
// before rollover when starting from a frame counter of 0.
//
// With 12 bits of fractional position, a mix job's interpolation precision is
// only +/-122 ppm. Across multiple mixes we stay in sync, but for any single
// mix this is our granularity. As an example, when resampling a 48 kHz audio
// packet, the "clicks on the dial" of actual resampling rates are 12 Hz
// increments. Again, we do correct any positional error at packet boundaries.
// TODO(mpuryear): MTWN-49 Use rate ratios (not frac_step_size) when resampling.
//
// This also affects interpolation accuracy: because fractional position has a
// potential error of 2^-12, the worst-case error for an interpolated value can
// be [pos_err * max_intersample_delta] -- or restated, only the top 12 bits of
// output audio are guaranteed to be accurate.
// TODO(mpuryear): MTWN-86 Consider increasing our fractional position precision
