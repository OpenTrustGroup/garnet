//
// In performing all of our audio analysis tests with a specific buffer length,
// we can choose input sinusoids with frequencies that perfectly fit within
// those buffers, eliminating the need for FFT windowing. Our measurement
// frequencies have been specifically chosen as approximations of the standard
// "3 freqs per octave" representative set, assuming a 65536/48000 ratio between
// buffer size and eventual sample rate.
//
// Working in concert with GenerateCosine, these summary frequencies (currently
// 40 Hz, 1 kHz and 12 kHz) are "phase-locked" to the size of the buffer used in
// our frequency-based testing, in that the actual frequency is calculated so
// that there is an exact integral number of complete sinusoidal periods within
// the source data buffer. This eliminates the need for us to performing
// windowing or other data conditioning before performing frequency analysis,
// although it does make the actual values sent to GenerateCosine slightly
// different than the actual frequency.

// Furthermore, we adjust these values slightly so that their periods are not
// closely related geometrically to the sample rate -- we do this so that
// sampling of a given sinusoid will be more statistically spread across the
// entire waveform, rather than this happening at just a few spots (for example,
// using approximately 11997.8 Hz instead of 12000 Hz).
//
// For now we assume an eventual 48 kHz output sample rate, so (along with our
// source buffer of size 65536) this translation ratio is 65536/48000. In other
// words, the 'freq' value that we should send to GenerateCosine in order to
// simulate a 1 kHz sinusoid would be 1363.

// To better model how our resamplers are used by the rest of the system, when
// testing our resamplers, we use multiple smaller jobs rather than mixing the
// entire 64k samples at one go. Breaking our 64k buffer into 256 subjobs will
// emulate ~5.33ms buffers (64k/256 = 256 samples @ 48kHz); breaking it into 128
// (512-sample packets) will model client submissions of ~10.67ms, etc.
//
// In our audio fidelity tests (noise floor, frequency response, SINAD, dynamic
// range, plus others in the future), we compare current measurements to
// previous results. For any set of inputs, our results are always exactly the
// same -- but we should note that (as currently implemented), configuration
// changes (such as adjustments to the below const) affect frequency response
// and SINAD results in ways that differ by frequency. Doubling the resampling
// packet size, as an example, may improve frequency response at 25 Hz but
// degrade it at 10 kHz. With this in mind, the values we have saved as
// thresholds represent the worst-case results across kResamplerTestNumPackets
// values of [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384,32768].
