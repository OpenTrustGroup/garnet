  // if the CodecFactory instance wants to self-destruct, it can delete the

  // ImplPtr isn't taking ownership; as long as we use std::unique_ptr as
  // ImplPtr it actaully willl take ownership.

  // will be chosen to decode that mime type, with an optional fallback to SW if
  // no driver supports the requested mime type.

  // interface.
