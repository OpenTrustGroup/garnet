// For now, this executable only knows about OMX .so libs (essentially as data
// deps), and won't load any others.
//
// The .so interface used between this executable and OMX .so libs is not part
// of the OMX standard, but it does stick to OMX C interfaces for the most part.
//
// The AOSP OMX codecs are just a convenient set of codecs to use as proof of
// concept.  The CodecFactory and Codec interfaces are more relevant system-wide
// than the OMX interfaces.  The OMX interfaces are used only in this
// executable.
//
// This executable serves up to one CodecFactory instance, only as a secondary
// implementation, with many assumptions re. the main CodecFactory's way of
// calling the secondary CodecFactory.  This process's CodecFactory interface is
// only served to the main CodecFactory, not to the client of the main
// CodecFactory.
//
// This executable's CodecFactory is used by the main CodecFactory
// implementation to create up to one Codec instance which is directly served in
// the local process, backed by an OMX codec instance, and served to the end
// client of the main CodecFactory.  For this reason, in contrast to the
// CodecFactory implementation which can make some simplifying interface usage
// assumptions, the Codec interface served by this process must be complete.
