// Thread-safety:
//   - |CancelWait(wait_id)| may only be called on the same thread as the
//     |AsyncWait()| that provided |wait_id| was called on.
//   - A given |FidlAsyncWaiter|'s functions may only be called on the thread(s)
//     that it is defined to be valid on (typically including the thread on
//     which the |FidlAsyncWaiter| was provided). E.g., a library may require
//     initialization with a single |FidlAsyncWaiter| and stipulate that it only
//     be used on threads on which that |FidlAsyncWaiter| is valid.
//   - If a |FidlAsyncWaiter| is valid on multiple threads, then its functions
//     must be thread-safe (subject to the first restriction above).

  // when |handle| satisfies |signals| or it is known that it will never satisfy
  // |signals| (with the same behavior as |zx_object_wait_one()|).
  //
  // |callback| will not be called in the nested context of |AsyncWait()|, but
  // only, e.g., from some run loop. |callback| is provided with the |closure|
  // argument as well as the result of the wait. For each call to |AsyncWait()|,
  // |callback| will be called at most once.
  //
  // |handle| must not be closed or transferred (via |zx_channel_write()| or
  // |zx_channel_call()|; this is equivalent to closing the handle) until either
  // the callback has been executed or the async wait has been cancelled using
  // the returned (nonzero) |FidlAsyncWaitID| (see |CancelWait()|). Otherwise,
  // an invalid (or, worse, re-used) handle may be waited on by the
  // implementation of this |FidlAsyncWaiter|.

  // becomes invalid.

  //
  // Once this has been called, the callback provided to |AsyncWait()| will not
  // be called. Moreover, it is then immediately safe to close or transfer the
