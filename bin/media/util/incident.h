// The Incident class provides a facility for executing code as the consequence
// of some occurrence. This can be useful for building state machines and
// otherwise dealing with asynchronous operations.
//
// Incident is not a thread-safe class and has no ability to make a thread wait
// or to execute code on a particular thread.
//
// Incidents rely heavily on std::function, so they shouldn't be used in
// enormous numbers.
//
// An Incident can be in one of two states: initial state or occurred state.
//
// Code can be executed when an incident occurs:
//
//     incident.When([]() {
//       // Do something...
//     });
//
// The behavior of the When method depends on the incident's state. In initial
// state, the consequence is added to a list to be executed when the incident
// occurs. In occurred state, When executes the consequence immediately (before
// When returns).
//
// An Incident occurs when its Occur (or Run) method is invoked and the Incident
// is in the initial state. All registered consequences of the Incident are
// executed during the call to Occur in the order they were added. Subsequent
// calls to Occur are ignored until the Incident is reset.
//
// The Reset method ensures that the Incident is in its initial state and that
// the list of consequences is cleared (without running the consequences).
