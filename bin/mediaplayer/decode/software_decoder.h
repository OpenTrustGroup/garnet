// Abstract base class for software decoders.
//
// This base class implements a simple model for packet transformation on a
// worker thread. Most member variables are accessed on the graph's main thread
// exclusively. The worker and main thread communicate via posted tasks.
//
// The worker's sole responsibility is to process a single input packet when
// |HandleInputPacketOnWorker| is called. The worker posts a call to
// |HandleOutputPacket| to the main thread for each output packet it generates.
// When the input packet is completely processed, the worker posts a call to
// |WorkerDoneWithInputPacket| to the main thread. Any number of calls to
// |HandleOutputPacket| may result from a single |HandleInputPacketOnWorker|
// call.
//
// The main thread logic, under normal operation, maintains an input packet in
// |input_packet_| so it's ready for decoding. When an output packet is
// requested, the main thread logic posts a call to |HandleInputPacketOnWorker|
// passing the input packet. A request for a new input packet is issued at that
// time.
//
// Downstream nodes (the renderer, probably) is responsible for requesting
// packets early enough to make sure it doesn't starve.
//
// The main thread logic uses packets delivered via |HandleOutputPacket| to
// satisfy the output packet request. Any additional output packets produced
// are queued by the stage. If |WorkerDoneWithInputPacket| is called without
// any output packet being delivered, the cycle begins again.
//
// Exceptions to this behavior are many:
// 1) Initially and after a flush, |input_packet_| is not proactively filled.
//    The initial request for an output packet causes the main thread logic to
//    request an input packet. |PutInputPacket| is called when it arrives.
// 2) A request for an output packet may arrive when |input_packet_| is empty.
//    In this case, the main thread logic yields until an input packet, arrives
//    via |PutInputPacket|.
// 3) Input packets from upstream and output packets from the worker thread are
//    discarded when the node is flushing.
// 4) The main thread logic desists from requesting input packets after an
//    end-of-stream input packet arrives (until the input is flushed). When an
//    end-of-stream input packet is processed by the worker, it must produce
//    an end-of-stream output packet immediately before posting
//    |WorkerDoneWithInputPacket|.
