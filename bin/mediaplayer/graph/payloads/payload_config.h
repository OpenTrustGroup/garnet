// Configuration constraints of an input or output.
//
// The max_xxx fields are used to determine how much memory will be required
// for payloads on the connection. An output must account for the payloads that
// will be held internal to its node as well as payloads queued on the
// connection. An input only needs to account for payloads that will be held
// internal to its node.
//
// The max_xxx fields overlap to some degree. This allows nodes that have only
// partial information to provide enough context for the payload manager to
// configure allocators correctly.
//
// In some cases, the payload manager needs to determine memory requirements
// for the output and input together. In other cases, it needs to determine
// memory requirements for just the output or just the input.
//
// For the combined case, memory requirement calculations look like this:
//
//     max_payload_count = output.max_payload_count + input.max_payload_count
//     max_payload_size = max(output.max_payload_size, input.max_payload_size)
//     max_aggregate_payload_size = max(output.max_aggregate_payload_size +
//                                          input.max_aggregate_payload_size,
//                                      max_payload_count * max_payload_size)
//
// max_aggregate_payload_size is then rounded up to the nearest multiple of
// max_payload_size. For the separate input or output case, the calculations
// look like this:
//
//     max_payload_count = this.max_payload_count
//     max_payload_size = max(this.max_payload_size, other.max_payload_size)
//     max_aggregate_payload_size = max(this.max_aggregate_payload_size,
//                                      max_payload_count * max_payload_size)
//
// Note that in either case, lack of good |max_aggregate_payload_size_| values
// can be compensated for by good |max_payload_count_| and |max_payload_size_|
// values. Here are some examples of how that plays out:
//
// 1) A video renderer input doesn't know max payload size, either individually
//    or in aggregate, but it does know how many payloads it needs to keep
//    around. The decoder output that feeds renderer knows the max payload size
//    and the number of payloads. This information is enough for the payload
//    manager to determine how much memory is needed for the output and input
//    combined and for each individually.
// 2) An audio renderer input doesn't know how big payloads will be, but it
//    knows how much payload it needs to hold in terms of time and therefore in
//    terms of bytes, so it has a good aggregate size. The decoder output that
//    feeds the renderer knows the size of the payloads it will produce and how
//    many it will need to keep around. Again, this is enough information for
//    the required calculations.
// TODO(dalesat): More.
