// - Implement route deletion.
// - How do we detect circular routes? Do we attempt to detect at rule
//   installation time? At runtime? Using what algorithm?

// NOTE on loopback addresses: Loopback addresses should be handled before
// reaching the forwarding table. For that reason, we do not prevent a rule
// whose subnet is a subset of the loopback subnet from being installed; they
// will never get triggered anyway, so implementing the logic of detecting these
// rules is a needless complexity.

/// `device` field). They are sent to a particular IP host on the local network
/// attached to that device, identified by `next_hop`. Note that `next_hop` is
/// not necessarily the destination IP address of the IP packet. In particular,
/// if the destination is not on the local network, the `next_hop` will be the
/// IP address of the next IP router on the way to the destination.
