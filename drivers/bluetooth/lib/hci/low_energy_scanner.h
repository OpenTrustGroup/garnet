  //     started, e.g. because discovery is already in progress, or it is in the
  //     process of being stopped, or the controller does not support discovery,
  //     etc.
  //
  //   - Synchronously returns true if the procedure was initiated but the it is
  //     unknown whether or not the procedure has succeeded.
  //
  //   - |callback| is invoked asynchronously to report the status of the
  //     procedure. In the case of failure, |callback| will be invoked once to
  //     report the end of the procedure. In the case of success, |callback|
  //     will be invoked twice: the first time to report that the procedure has
  //     started, and a second time to report when the procedure ends, either
  //     due to a timeout or cancellation.
  //
  //   - |period| specifies (in milliseconds) the duration of the scan. If the
  //     special value of kPeriodInfinite is passed then scanning will continue
  //     indefinitely and must be explicitly stopped by calling StopScan().
  //     Otherwise, the value must be non-zero.
  //
  // Once started, a scan can be terminated at any time by calling the
  // StopScan() method. Otherwise, an ongoing scan will terminate at the end of
  // the scan period if a finite value for |period_ms| was provided.
  //
  // If an active scan is being performed, then scannable advertising reports
  // will NOT generate an OnDeviceFound event until a scan response is received
  // from the corresponding broadcaster. If a scan response from a scannable
  // device is never received during a scan period, then an OnDeviceFound event
  // (exluding scan response data) will be generated for that device at the end
  // of the scan period, UNLESS the scan was explicitly stopped via StopScan().
