// A SequentialCommandRunner can be used to chain HCI commands such that
// commands in the sequence are sent to the controller only after previous
// commands have completed successfully.
//
// When a command fails due to an error status (in a HCI_Command_Status or
// HCI_Command_Complete event), the rest of the sequence is abandoned and an
// error status is reported back to the caller. Already sent commands will
// continue and report their statuses back to their individual callbacks.
//
// Only commands that terminate with the HCI_Command_Complete event are
// currently supported.
//
// Commands are always sent in the order that they are queued.  If any command
// fails, unsent commands are abandoned.
//
// Parts of the sequence can be run in parallel by using the |wait| parameter
// of QueueCommand.  If |wait| is true, all commands queued before that command
// must complete (and succeed) before the command will be sent.
//
// For example:
// QueueCommand(a, [](const auto&){}, true);
// QueueCommand(b, [](const auto&){}, false);
// QueueCommand(c, [](const auto&){}, false);
// QueueCommand(d, [](const auto&){}, true);
// QueueCommand(e, [](const auto&){}, false);
// RunCommands([](auto){});
//
// Command a, b, and c will be run simultaneously.  If any failed, then
// RunCommands will report that error back to the caller.  All three of a, b,
// and c's callbacks are run.  If all three succeeded, then d and e will run
// simultaneously, and when both complete, the whole sequence is complete and
// RunCommands will report success.
//
// This class is not thread-safe. The dispatcher that is provided during
// initialization must be bound to the thread on which the instance of
// SequentialCommandRunner is being constructed.
