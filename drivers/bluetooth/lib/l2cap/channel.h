// Represents a L2CAP channel. Each instance is owned by a service
// implementation that operates on the corresponding channel. Instances can only
// be obtained from a ChannelManager.
//
// A Channel can operate in one of 6 L2CAP Modes of Operation (see Core Spec
// v5.0, Vol 3, Part A, Section 2.4). Only Basic Mode is currently supported.
//
// USAGE:
//
// Channel is an abstract base class. There are two concrete implementations:
//
//   * internal::ChannelImpl (defined below) which implements a real L2CAP
//     channel. Instances are obtained from ChannelManager and tied to
//     internal::LogicalLink instances.
//
//   * FakeChannel, which can be used for unit testing service-layer entities
//     that operate on one or more L2CAP channel(s).
//
// Production instances are obtained from a ChannelManager. Channels are safe to
// activate, deactivate, and destroy on any thread.
//
// A Channel's owner must explicitly call Deactivate() and must not rely on
// dropping its reference to close the channel.
//
// When a LogicalLink closes, All of its  active channels become deactivated
// when it closes and this is signaled by running the ClosedCallback passed to
// Activate().
class Channel : public fbl::RefCounted<Channel> {

  // Callback invoked when this channel has been closed without an explicit
  // request from the owner of this instance. For example, this can happen when
  // the remote end closes a dynamically configured channel or when the
  // underlying logical link is terminated through other means.
  using ClosedCallback = std::function<void()>;

  // Callback invoked when a new SDU is received on this channel. Any previously
  // buffered SDUs will be sent to |rx_cb| right away, provided that |rx_cb| is
  // not empty and the underlying logical link is active.
  using RxCallback = std::function<void(const SDU& sdu)>;

  // Activates this channel on |task_runner|. |rx_callback| and
  // |closed_callback| will run on |task_runner|.
  //

  // underlying link can be removed at any time.
