  // At least for now, we don't use a separate object instance for the current

  //   * This interface is the validated+de-async-ed version of the Codec FIDL

  //     object/channel, so not having a separate stream object here makes the
  //     correspondence closer.
  //   * While the stream is fairly separate, there are also aspects of stream
  //     behavior such as mid-stream output format change which can cause a
  //     stream to essentially re-configure codec-wide output buffers, so the
  //     separate-ness of a stream from the codec isn't complete (regardless of
  //     separate stream object or not).
  //
  // All that said, it certainly can be useful to think of the stream as a
  // logical lifetime of a thing, despite it not being a separate object (at
