// The CodecImpl class can be used for both SW and HW codecs.
//
// Roughly speaking, this class converts the Codec FIDL interface which has
// cross-process pipelining of stream switches into a more synchronous
// in-process CodecAdapter interface which only has input and output data
// handled async, with stream control handled sync for the most part.
//
// This class also handles Codec protocol checks applicable to any Codec server.
//
// TODO(dustingreen): Pull CodecImpl out to a source_set, to be used by
// omx_codec_runner.h/cc also.

// Lifetime:
//
// A CodecImpl is created, either Bind()ed or destructed, and if Bind()ed, then
// later when the channel fails or there's a protocol error, calls the owner's
// error handler and the owner deletes the CodecImpl.  There is intentionally no
// way to re-use a CodecImpl for another Codec channel.

// Error handling:
//
// There are two types of errors, per-CodecImpl errors and per-devhost-process
// errors.
//
// Per-CodecImpl:
//
// We handle per-Codec protocol errors and the like by calling Unbind() on the
// CodecImpl, which fairly soon results in ~CodecImpl async, but does not exit
// the whole devhost process.  We also handle a few per-CodecImpl errors this
// way even though some of those are closer to being caused by per-devhost
// conditions, just in case.
//
// Per-devhost-process:
//
// In contrast, per-devhost error conditions, like the inability to post work to
// the shared_fidl_thread(), are handled by exiting the devhost, because those
// conditions are not really unique to any one CodecImpl.

  // stream_lifetime_ordinal of a stream that the client has since told the

  // stuck waiting on a client to catch up to an output config that the client
  // won't process.  Instead, the StreamControl ordering domain can ignore any
  // additional messages related to the discarded stream until the stream
  // discarding message is reached at which point the core codec's mid-stream
  // output config change is cancelled/forgotten when we reset the core codec.
  //
  // In addition, if we're behind, we can catch up by skipping past some
  // messages for future-discarded streams to catch up to non-discarded stream
  // input quicker.  Theoretically we could do even better by having the FIDL
  // thread delete messages previously queued to the StreamControl domain
  // regarding a stream that is now known to be discarded by the FIDL thread,
  // and collapse/combine CloseCurrentStream() messages, but that's unlikely to
  // help much in practice and would make the implementation more difficult to
  // read, and we can mitigate unbounded queuing by demanding that clients not
  // get too far ahead else we close the channel.  While forcing a client to
  // wait isn't great, if we don't, we can't impose a circuit-breaker limit on
