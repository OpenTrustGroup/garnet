// This class is just _a_ codec client, and should be read as an example only,
// and probably not a fully complete example either.  This class is just here
// to organize the code involved in seting up a Codec with input buffers and
// packets, feeding it input data in a single Stream, setting up the output
// buffers and packets, and ensuring that all input data is processed into
// output.
//
// A Codec client that wants to seek a logical stream or re-use a Codec to
// decode another logical stream would likely want to make more use of the
// stream_lifetime_ordinal to feed input data and to accept output data (vs.
// this example which has only one Stream lifetime which isn't visible outside
// this class. Re-using a Codec instance for a new stream is encouraged,
// especially when the output format isn't likely to change from stream to
// stream, which avoids re-configuring output buffers across the stream switch.
//
// The use of particular threads of execution to call this class is intended to
// clarify reasonable ordering and concurrency of messages sent and processed on
// the Codec interface.  There is no requirement that a Codec client use
// dedicated threads to achieve a permitted and useful ordering. The client does
// of course need to stay within the sequencing rules of the interface.

  // loop - The loop that all the FIDL work will run on.  We configure this
  // explicitly instead of using the default loop per thread mechanism, because
  // we want to be very sure that we'll be posting to the correct loop to send
  // messages using that loop's single thread, as ProxyController doesn't have
  // a lock_ in it.

  // fields.
  //
  // Since in this example we're using a buffer per packet, waiting for a free
  // packet is also waiting for a free buffer, with the same index as
  // packet_index.
  //
  // To return eventually, this call relies on output being accepted on an
  // ongoing basis from the Codec using some other thread(s), processed, and

  // the stream to be done.  If an end_of_stream packet shows up, this method

  //
  // The returned CodecPacket itself will remain valid and readable as long as

  // data in the corresponding output buffer before calling this method again.
