# Mozart Spinning Square Example

This directory contains an application which draws an animated spinning
square using the scene manager.

From garnet, this can be run with `set_root_view spinning_square_view`.
From topaz, this can be run with `launch spinning_square_view`.

In garnet, Alt+Esc toggles back and forth between the console and graphics.
