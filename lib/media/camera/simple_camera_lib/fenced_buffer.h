// FencedBuffer includes acquire and release fences
// which allow the locked or available status of the buffer to be
// signaled across processes. The fences follow the usage pattern
// described in image_pipe.fidl:
// The acquire fence signals the consumer that the writing is complete,
// and the release fence is signalled from the consumer that the
// frame is no longer needed for reading. These fences are indended for
// communication between only 2 processes; the fences are both reset upon
// receipt of the release fence signal.
// The state transitions of the buffer are thus:
// acquire fence  | release fence | state
//       0        |       0       |   Buffer is in writer control.
//                |               |   The writer may be writing to the buffer.
//       1        |       0       |   Buffer is done writing, signals the
//                                    consumer.
//       X        |       1       |   Consumer is done.  The buffer calls
//                                    OnReleaseFenceSignalled, and resets the
//                                    fences.
// FencedBuffer also adds an index variable, which is used for external
// record-keeping.  The index variable does not influence the internal
// workings of this class.
