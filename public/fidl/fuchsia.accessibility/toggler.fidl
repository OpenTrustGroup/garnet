// This interface is intended to provide a simple centralized switch to turn
// on or off accessibility support throughout the system. We intend for this to
// be implemented solely by the accessibility manager, and called solely by a privileged
// client, such as the user shell.

  // Allows for enabling or disabling accessibility support in services connected to the

  1: ToggleAccessibilitySupport(bool enabled);
};

// The accessibility toggle broadcaster notifies clients when the toggler receives a call to
// toggle accessibility support.
// The current intended audience for this includes:
// - Front-ends like Flutter which need to enable semantic information for accessibility.
// - Root presenter, which needs to re-route raw input to an accessibility input dispatch.
// - Accessibility touch dispatcher, which should only be enabled when accessibility is turned on.

  // use this to enable or disable their own custom accessibility support.
