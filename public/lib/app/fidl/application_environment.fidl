  // Creates a new environment nested inside this environment.
  //
  // When applications are created inside the nested environment using the
  // environment's |ApplicationLauncher|, the environment requests the
  // environment services from |host_directory| before passing those services to
  // the newly created application in its |ApplicationStartupInfo|.
  //
  // Typically the |host_directory| will make the newly created |environment|
  // available in the environment services, giving child applications to launch
  // other applications in the environment and to create nested environments.
  //
  // The |host_directory| must provide an |ApplicationLoader| service (or
  // inherit one from its parent) if it wishes to allow new applications to be
  // loaded in the nested environment.
  //
  // The |controller| can be used to control the lifecycle of the created
  // environment. If an |ApplicationEnvironmentController|'s interface is
  // request, the environment will be killed when the interface is closed.
  //
  // The |label| is an optional name to associate with the environment for
  // diagnostic purposes.  The label will be truncated if it is longer
  // than |kLabelMaxLength|.
