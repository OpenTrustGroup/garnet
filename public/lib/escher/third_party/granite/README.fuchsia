Heavily-modified versions of a small number of files from the Granite rendering
engine.  These files now bear little immediate resemblance to the originals;
the differences will only grow over time.  Generally speaking, these changes
fall into the following categories:
  - adding this README.fuchsia file
  - refactoring to work with existing Escher code
  - compliance with Fuchsia and Escher code style guidelines
  - changes to go beyond functionality provided by Granite

The Granite code has been very instructive, and we would like to take this
opportunity to express our gratitude to Hans-Kristian Arntzen for his generous
contributions.

Each file in this directory indicates the corresponding Granite file(s) that it
is based on.
