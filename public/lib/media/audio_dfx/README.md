# Device Effects

The _device effect_ (DFX) interface enables device makers and system builders
to add custom audio processing at a location in the audio pipeline that is
unavailable to normal audio clients. This processing can be performed on the
final mixed output audio stream right before it is consumed by playback
hardware, and/or on an incoming stream immediately after it is produced by
input hardware before it is provided to clients of the audio capture API.

The following interfaces, structures and constants are specified in the
**audio_device_fx.h** file.


## **System description**
The Fuchsia audio system calls these device effects using the "C" ABI specified
by the following nine interface calls and their related structs and consts. The
system dynamically loads the library `audio_dfx.so` by name and calls the
synchronous functions described below, to query and configure the effect, and
subsequently to process audio while it is actively streaming.

The DFX library can contain numerous different effects (such as an equalizer, a
volume limiter, and a reverb); these are called _effect types_. For a given
effect type, at any time there may be multiple independent copies of the effect
that are active; each is called an _effect instance_. This is not unlike an
object hierarchy; effect types equate to classes, and effect instances are
analogous to instantiated objects of that class.

Additionally, an effect can be configured by settings that govern its behavior
(such as EQ parameters or reverb decay time); these parameters, and their
values, are called effect _controls_ and _control values_ respectively.
Mirroring the object-oriented design mentioned above, controls are defined
across a given effect type, but each instance of that effect has an independent
set of values for those settings.

This low-level interface does not provide effects with any knowledge of where
they are being inserted in the processing chain. This allows the system to be
flexibly configured. However, a settings file that accompanies the
audio_dfx.so (discussed elsewhere, TBD) is used to instruct the system which
effects should be used, in which topology, with which control values.

The settings file, and the FIDL interface to control the enabling, ordering and
configuration of specific effects on specific devices, are described in
separate README (TBD) for that higher level API.


## **APIs**
Below are input parameters, return values and usage notes for the Audio DFX
(device effects) APIs. Each of these nine functions must be implemented in the
audio_dfx.so shared library.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_num_effects**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_num_effects(
    uint32_t* num_effects_out
  );
```

#### Inputs
- **num_effects_out**: pointer to a *uint32_t* allocated by the system. This
is where the DFX implementation should copy the number of device effect types
available in this module.

#### Returns
- **true**: call succeeded; `*num_effects_out` contains the number of device
effects available.
- **false**: call failed; `*num_effects_out` is undefined.

#### Notes
This interface returns the number of effect types found in this audio_dfx lib.
The value returned from this interface is important for subsequent APIs, where
the required `effect_id` value must be less than the reported number of effect
types (per zero-based indexing).

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_info**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_info(
    uint32_t effect_id,
    fuchsia_audio_dfx_description* device_fx_desc
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **effect_id**: a *uint32_t* representing the effect type being queried. This
value must be less than the number of effect types reported by
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_num_effects**.
- **device_fx_desc**: pointer to a *fuchsia_audio_dfx_description* struct
allocated by the system. The DFX implementation should copy information about
this device effect type into this struct.

#### Returns
- **true**: call succeeded; the struct `*device_fx_desc` contains information
about the specified effect type.
- **false**: call failed; the contents of struct `*device_fx_desc` are
undefined.

#### Notes
This interface returns information about this type of effect, including number
of controls. The `num_controls` value returned from this interface is important
for subsequent APIs, where the required `control_num` value must be less than
the reported number of controls for this effect type (per zero-based indexing).

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_control_info**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_control_info(
    uint32_t effect_id,
    uint16_t control_num,
    fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description* device_fx_control_desc
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **effect_id**: a *uint32_t* representing the effect type being queried. This
value must be less than the number of effect types reported by
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_num_effects**.
- **control_num**: a *uint16_t* representing the effect control being queried
for this effect type. This value must be less than the number of controls
reported by **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_info**.
- **device_fx_control_desc**: pointer to a
*fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description* struct allocated by the system. The DFX
implementation should copy information about the specified control into this
struct.

#### Returns
- **true**: call succeeded; the struct `*device_fx_control_desc` contains
information about the specified effect control.
- **false**: call failed; contents of struct `*device_fx_control_desc` are
undefined.

#### Notes
This interface returns information related to the identified effect type.
Specifically, it returns details about a particular control on that effect.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create**
```
fx_token_t fuchsia_audio_dfx_create(
    uint32_t effect_id,
    uint32_t frame_rate,
    uint16_t channels_in,
    uint16_t channels_out
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **effect_id**: a *uint32_t* representing the effect type being queried. This
value must be less than the number of effect types reported by
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_num_effects**.
- **frame_rate**: a *uint32_t* representing the frame rate (in Hertz) for the
audio stream that will flow through the created audio device effect. The
created effect must be capable of operating at this rate.
- **channels_in**: a *uint16_t* representing the number of channels in the
audio stream that will flow into the created audio device effect. The created
effect must be capable of accepting an input stream with this number of
channels.
- **channels_out**: a *uint16_t* representing the number of channels in the
audio stream that will flow out of the created audio device effect. The created
effect must be capable of generating an output stream with this number of
channels.

#### Returns
- **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_INVALID_TOKEN**: call failed; no resources should be
allocated.
- **Otherwise**: call succeeded; the returned `fx_token_t` is a token
representing the just-created active instance of this effect type.

#### Notes
The value that this call returns will be used as `dfx_token`, in subsequent API
calls that reference a particular effect instance.

When the values of `channels_in` and `channels_out` are equal, the system will
require the created device effect to process audio in-place.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_delete**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_delete(
    fx_token_t dfx_token
  );
```
#### Inputs
- None

#### Returns
- **true**: the specified effect instance has been deleted, and this token is no
longer valid.
- **false**: invalid effect token; no further action was taken.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_parameters**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_parameters(
    fx_token_t dfx_token,
    fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters* device_fx_params
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **dfx_token**: a `fx_token_t` representing an active effect instance.
- **device_fx_params**: pointer to a *fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters* struct
allocated by the system. The DFX implementation should copy information about
the specified active effect instance into this struct.

#### Returns
- **true**: the struct `*device_fx_params` contains information about the
specified effect instance.
- **false**: call failed; contents of struct `*device_fx_params` are undefined.

#### Notes
This interface returns the operational parameters for this instance of the
device effect. These parameters are invariant for the lifetime of this effect,
based on the initial values provided when the client created the effect.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_control_value**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_get_control_value(
    fx_token_t dfx_token,
    uint16_t control_num,
    float* value_out
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **dfx_token**: a `fx_token_t` representing an active effect instance.
- **control_num**: a `uint16_t` representing a control of this effect instance.
- **value_out**: a pointer to a `float` allocated by the system, into which the
DFX implementation should copy the current value of this control.

#### Returns
- **true**: `*value_out` contains the current value of this control.
- **false**: call failed; `*value_out` is undefined.

#### Notes
This interface returns the value for the specified control on this active
effect.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_set_control_value**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_set_control_value(
    fx_token_t dfx_token,
    uint16_t control_num,
    float value
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **dfx_token**: a `fx_token_t` representing an active effect instance.
- **control_num**: a `uint16_t` representing a control of this effect instance.
- **value**: a `float` containing the value to which this control should be set.

#### Returns
- **true**: the value of the specified control was successfully changed.
- **false**: the value of the specified control is unchanged.

#### Notes
This interface sets the value of the specified control, on this active effect.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_reset**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_reset(
    fx_token_t dfx_token
  );
```
#### Inputs
- None

#### Returns
- **true**: the specified effect instance has been reverted to its initial
state, including all settings and any internally cached state (such as
previously processed audio).
- **false**: invalid effect token; no further action was taken.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace(
    fx_token_t dfx_token,
    uint32_t num_frames,
    float* audio_buff_in_out
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **dfx_token**: a `fx_token_t` representing an active effect instance.
- **num_frames**: a `uint32_t` containing the number of frames that the
specified effect instance must process. This value cannot exceed the
previously-set frame rate for this effect instance.
- **audio_buff_in_out**: a pointer to an audio buffer containing samples of
type `float`.

#### Returns
- **true**: call succeeded; the effect instance successfully processed
`num_frames` of audio samples, in-place within the buffer specified by
`audio_buff_in_out`.
- **false**: call failed; the contents of buffer `audio_buff_in_out` are
undefined.

#### Notes
This interface synchronously processes the buffer of `num_frames` audio data
in-place. The total number of samples processed is equal to `num_frames`
multiplied by the value of `channels_out`, from the earlier
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_create** call.

**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace** is used in all cases except where
rechannelization occurs. It is preferred over **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process**
because of its reduced memory consumption and related system impact.

The upper limit on the value of `num_frames` guarantees that no
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace** call will ever entail more than one
second of audio.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_process(
    fx_token_t dfx_token,
    uint32_t num_frames,
    const float* audio_buff_in,
    float* audio_buff_out
  );
```
#### Inputs
- **dfx_token**: a `fx_token_t` representing an active effect instance.
- **num_frames**: a `uint32_t` containing the number of frames that the
specified effect instance must process. This value cannot exceed the
previously-set frame rate for this effect instance.
- **audio_buff_in**: a pointer to a buffer containing audio samples of type
`float`, from which `num_frames` audio frames must be ingested by the effect
instance.
- **audio_buff_out**: a pointer to a buffer where `num_frames` audio frames of
type `float` must be produced, based on the data ingested from `audio_buff_in`.

#### Returns
- **true**: call succeeded; the effect instance successfully processed
`num_frames` of audio samples from the buffer specified by `audio_buff_in`, to
the buffer specified by `audio_buff_out`.
- **false**: call failed; the contents of buffer `audio_buff_out` are
undefined.

#### Notes
This interface synchronously processes ‘num_frames’ of audio data in type float,
from `audio_buff_in` to `audio_buff_out`. The total number of input samples
ingested is equal to `num_frames` multiplied by the value of `channels_in` from
the earlier **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create** call. The total number of output
samples generated and populated into `audio_buff_out` is equal to `num_frames`
multiplied by the value of `channels_out` from that same
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_create** call.

This interface is necessary for cases where rechannelization occurs; it is not
used otherwise. Where possible, the system instead uses
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace**, because of its reduced memory consumption
and related system impact.

The upper limit on the value of `num_frames` guarantees that no
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process** call will ever entail more than one second of
audio.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_flush**
```
bool fuchsia_audio_dfx_flush(
    fx_token_t dfx_token
  );
```
#### Inputs
- None

#### Returns
- **true**: any internal cached state (such as previously processed audio)
has been discarded.
- **false**: invalid effect token; no further action was taken.

#### Notes
Flushing an effect instance does not return its *settings* to their initial
state. To do that, **fuchsia_audio_dfx_reset** must be called.


## **Typedefs and Structs**

Below are fields and usages for the Media Client structs:

### **fx_token_t**
```
typedef void* fx_token_t;
```
This token represents an active instance of an effect. They are guaranteed to be
unique, although new values might recycle those of previously-deleted effect
instances.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_description**
```
typedef struct {
  char name[FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
  uint16_t num_controls;
  uint16_t incoming_channels;
  uint16_t outgoing_channels;
} fuchsia_audio_dfx_description;
```

#### name
This string is a descriptive (user-facing) name for the specified audio device
effect type.

#### num_controls
This indicates the number of settable controls on this effect type -- in a way,
the "number of knobs and buttons" for this audio processor. For each of these
controls, the system can retrieve a corresponding
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description** struct (see below).

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description**
```
typedef struct {
  char name[FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
  float max_val;
  float min_val;
  float initial_val;
} fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description;
```

#### name
This string is a descriptive (user-facing) name for the specified control on
this audio device effect.

#### max_val
This is the maximum value that can be set for this control.

#### min_val
This is the minimum value that can be set for this control.

#### initial_val
This is the value of the specified control, at the time this effect instance
was created.

### **fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters**
```
typedef struct {
  uint32_t frame_rate;
  uint16_t channels_in;
  uint16_t channels_out;
  uint32_t signal_latency_frames;
  uint32_t suggested_frames_per_buffer;
} fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters;
```

#### frame_rate
This is the sampling rate (in Hertz) of the incoming and outgoing frames of
audio data.

#### channels_in
This is the number of channels in the incoming stream that is passed to the
device effect instance via **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process** or
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace** calls. This value is important for
calculating the correct number of samples to ingest (specifically, multiply this
value by `num_frames`). As specified in `media_types.fidl`, the maximum number
of input channels currently supported is 8.

#### channels_out
This is the number of channels in the outgoing stream produced by the device
effect instance via **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process** or
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace** calls. This value is important for
calculating the correct number of samples to generate and populate
(specifically, multiply this value by `num_frames`). As specified in
`media_types.fidl`, the maximum number of input channels currently supported is
8.

Note that channel order is not explicitly specified here; where appropriate, the
generally-accepted channel-ordering will be assumed (such as 5.1 ordering if 6
channels is specified). We acknowledge that this is inadequate specification for
many use cases, but suggest that for now it may be adequate.

#### signal_latency_frames
This is the group delay (in frames) caused by the audio processing algorithm
itself, considering the parameters specified by **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create**
(most notably `frame_rate`) when this effect instance was created. As an
example, a basic volume effect should report a value of 0, since it will adds
no "right-shift" of any kind when considering the incoming audio signal within
the audio buffer; restated, this example effect needs no additional information
beyond the first input sample itself, in order to produce the first output
sample (hence a reported value of 0 frames of delay added). As another example,
an effect that operates in the frequency domain would set this value based on
the window size it uses (512, for example).

#### suggested_frames_per_buffer
The effect uses this value to indicate a `num_frames` value at which it most
effectively executes the calls **fuchsia_audio_dfx_process** or
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_process_inplace**.

In general, this value represents the effect-creator's suggested balance
between latency (which is minimized by smaller values) and efficiency (which is
maximized by larger values). Effects that use frequency-domain processing can
use this parameter to indicate the optimal window size for their algorithm.
With this in mind, this value indicates not merely the ideal size of any single
process call, but rather the ongoing alignment stride from the very start of
processing.

This value is advisory-only. The system is not obligated to honor this request
(indeed, in the case of multiple effects chained in series, this may not even
be possible). Rather, the system makes decisions of this kind with the goal of
optimizing overall system behavior, including responsiveness, fidelity,
throughput, power consumption and other factors.


## **Constants**
Below are constant values used with the DFX interfaces and structs:

### **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_INVALID_TOKEN**
```
const fx_token_t FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_INVALID_TOKEN = 0;
```
This value is returned by **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create**, if an effect instance
with the specified parameters _cannot_ be created.

### **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_ANY**
```
const uint16_t FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_ANY =
    std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max();
```
This value can be returned in a **fuchsia_audio_dfx_description** struct, to
indicate that an effect can potentially accomodate any number of channels. This
value may NOT be used in **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create** calls or
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters** structs, as `channels_in` and `channels_out` in
those contexts indicate the actual number of channels in the effect instance,
rather than the possible values.

### **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_SAME_AS_IN**
```
const uint16_t FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_SAME_AS_IN =
    std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max() - 1;
```
This value can be returned in a **fuchsia_audio_dfx_description** struct for the
value of `outgoing_channels`, to indicate that the number of output channels
must equal the number of input channels. An effect should only use this if it
reports its `incoming_channels` as **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_ANY**.

### **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_MAX**
```
const uint16_t FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_CHANNELS_MAX = 256;
```
This is the maximum value allowed in **fuchsia_audio_dfx_create** calls or in
the **fuchsia_audio_dfx_parameters** struct. It can also be used in
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_description** structs, but note that in practice, effects
are constrained by the number of channels supported by actual audio hardware.
Currently the Fuchsia audio system limits this to MAX_PCM_CHANNEL_COUNT, which
is less than this value.

### **FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_MAX_NAME_LENGTH**
```
const size_t FUCHSIA_AUDIO_DFX_MAX_NAME_LENGTH = 255;
```
This value is used as an outer limit on the lengths of names of effects and
their controls. This const is important because it determines the effective
size of the structs **fuchsia_audio_dfx_description** and
**fuchsia_audio_dfx_control_description** (see above).
