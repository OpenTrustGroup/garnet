// A special value which may be written into the PTS field in certain
// circumstances.  For example, depending on the specific scenario,
// kNoTimestamp may be used if...
//
// 1) The timestamp of a packet is simply not known.
// 2) A client wishes for the timestamp of a packet to be interpolated based
//    on nominal frame rate and previous packet timestamps.
// 3) A client wishes to schedule a packet or timeline transformation to take

//
//  ** EOS
//     This payload represents the end of a stream.  For example, EOS
//     may be set on a packet which represents the final payload in a stream
//     of compressed video, causing a video codec to flush out any remaining
//     frames it may be holding onto because of frame-reordering dependencies.
//
//  ** Keyframe
//     This packet represents a point in a compressed sequence which depends
//     on no other packets in the sequence.  In other words, this is a random
//     access point at which the decoder may start decoding.  For example, an
//     I-Frame in an MPEG2 video sequence is a "keyframe".  All audio payloads
//     in an MP1L3 sequences are independently decodable, and therefor
//     "keyframes".
//
//  ** Dropable
//     This packet represents data in a compressed sequence which no other
//     packets depend on.  For example, a B-Frame in an MPEG2 video sequence
//     produces no reference frames.
//
//  ** Discontinuous
//     This packet represents data which is discontinuous from a timing
//     perspective from the previous delivered packet in the sequence.  For
//     example packets containing audio frames with audio frame numbers
//     [0, 999], [1000, 1999] and [2500, 2999] are delivered, the first two
//     packets are continuous with each other, but the 3rd packet is
//     discontinuous relative to the 2nd.
