# Sketchy

Sketchy allows users to draw animated strokes, which are automatically inserted
into the Scenic scene-graph.  In addition to interactive drawing of strokes,
Sketchy also supports procedural generation of strokes, persistently storing
them to the Ledger, and collaborative sketching via Croquet.
