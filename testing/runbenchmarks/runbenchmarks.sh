# Whether any errors occurred while running benchmarks.
_got_errors=0

# A string of JSON objects representing benchmark results.
#
# The contents of this string are written to a `summary.json` file after all
# benchmarks have run.  Infra uses this file when running benchmarks on hardware
# as a sort of manifest.  It indicates which tests ran, where their output files
# are located, and whether a test passed or failed.  `runbench_exec` records
# each run in this summary.  The summary's schema is defined at:
# https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/system/uapp/runtests/summary-schema.json
_benchmark_summaries=""

# Runs a command and expects a results file to be produced.
#
# If the results file was not generated, an error message is logged and a
# benchmark failure is recorded.
#
# @param {string} The expected results file.
# @param {...} Set of arguments that make up the command-to-run.
#
# Example:
#
#    runbench_exec "$OUT_DIR/my_benchmark" trace record  \
#        --spec-file=/path/to/my_benchmark.tspec         \
#        --benchmark-results-file="$OUT_DIR/my_benchmark"

# lists all of the benchmarks that ran, along with their results.  This should
# be the same output directory that results files have been written to.
#

    # `output_file` must be a path relative to summary.json.  We'll emit
    # summary.json in the same directory as results files, so the filename is
    # also fine to use here.
